# 🌿 Leafy

**Leafy** is your cozy terminal companion for transferring media from external drives. It turns the chore of manual file transfers into a breezy, interactive experience right in your shell.

### 💡 Motivation

I started vlogging my motorcycle journey recently, and found files transferring from my action camera and external mic is a *very* tedious task. So **Leafy** is created to automate the process. Now I can quickly and easily transfer all the captured media to my editing PC by simply running **Leafy** in the terminal! 🙌

### 🚀 Quickstart

A binary will be released on GitHub later. Alternatively, you can install it using Go.

```bash
# Option 1: Install with Go
go install github.com/Nightails/Leafy@latest

# Option 2: Download the binary
# 1. Download: Download the latest binary from the Releases page.
# 2. Permissions: Ensure the binary is executable:
chmod +x leafy
# 3. Run: Execute the binary:
./leafy
```

### 📖 Usage

General usage instructions:

- **Automatic Scanning**: The app starts scanning for USB devices immediately upon launch.
- **Navigation**: Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to move through the list of detected devices.
- **Selection**: Press `enter` to select a device for further actions.
- **Manual Scan**: Press `s` at any time to trigger a new scan of your USB ports.
- **Exiting**: Press `ctrl+c` to safely exit the application.

### 🤝 Contributing

To set up Leafy for local development, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

-   **Go** (version 1.25 or later)
-   **lsblk**: The application relies on the `lsblk` command-line utility (usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions).
